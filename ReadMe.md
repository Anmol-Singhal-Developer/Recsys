# Food & Restaurant Recommendation System

This project is a smart food discovery platform that helps users get personalized suggestions for both **recipes** and **restaurants**. It combines machine learning models with user interaction history and content data to give meaningful food recommendations. It also supports recipe uploads, grocery list creation, and shows nutrition info.
